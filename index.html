					<h1>The Intro:</h1>
					<p>Moving is one of the toughest, and most stressful times in our lives.  Where should I move?  How safe is the community?  How much will it cost me?  These are the typical questions we ask before making the final decision to move.  If you’re like me though, one of the most important questions you would like answered is: How am I treated after my lease is signed?</p>
					<p>There is no doubt that you will be treated like royalty the first time you walk into a leasing office, but what happens once you sign a lease? Are you still treated with the same respect and dignity you deserve?  The purpose of this message is to help answer this question, and provide you the insight you deserve before deciding to live at Post Lindbergh Apartments.</p>
					<p>Please keep in mind as you read, that I’m in no way affiliated with Post Properties, and I am only recounting my experience as a former resident of the community.  Below you will read about three separate events that should help answer the question of how well you are treated once you become a resident of Post Lindbergh.  I hope this in someway helps you. Enjoy.</p>
					
					<h2>The Break-in:</h2>
					<p>Come on, it happens right?  In a city as large as Atlanta there are bound to be apartment break-ins. I fell victim to one such break-in on October 26, 2010.  I flew home immediately and began the process of filing the appropriate insurance claims. I also began working with the leasing office with the hopes of finding out who it was that broke into my apartment.  The nature of the break-in led me to believe that the intruder may have been someone with a previous knowledge of my apartment. With that in mind, and knowing that Post Lindbergh has surveillance cameras near the entrance, I asked the leasing office if I could sit with someone and review the tapes taken from those cameras with the hopes of recognizing someone (or their vehicle) entering the community.</p>
					<p>The leasing office put me in contact with Post Properties’ corporate security officer, and I explained to him the situation.  He told me that he would locate the tapes and let me know when I could come review the tapes with him.  I phoned him again after not hearing back from him, and I was told that the tapes couldn’t be located for the particular day in question.  He added however, that the tape should be archived on their system somewhere and he would have one of his computer techs attempt to locate the missing footage.  That was the last communication I had with him.  Over the next couple of weeks I tried a few times to reach him, but only got his voicemail.</p>
					<p>Knowing that the number of break-ins had increased at Post Lindbergh around that time I tried discussing with the leasing office why it was happening, and what actions we could take to help prevent future break-ins.  In the end, they basically told me that because of the community's close proximity to a public transportation hub, and the increase in criminal activity near the holidays, there was little that could be done to prevent such break-ins. They also explained that break-ins were one of the reasons they require residents to acquire renter’s insurance.</p>
					<p>The lack of response from Post Properties’ security officer combined with the mindset of their leasing office made it clear to me that providing a secure community was not a high priority for Post Lindbergh. Excuses were so easy to provide, and thanks to renter’s insurance, which pays for most damages, apartment break-ins do not have much of a financial impact Post Lindbergh.  If it isn't costing them money, guess you couldn’t expect them to spend a little to make it somewhat challenging for a criminal to get away cleanly.</p>
					<p>All that I could do is simply shake my head, purchase ADT, and move on with my life, which brings us to the next chapter...</p>
					
					<h2>The Floods:</h2>
					<p>Living on the bottom floor is great during the move-in process, but then you have to face the fact that you are at the mercy of your neighbors upstairs. I was flooded a total of three times while living at Post Lindbergh, two of which were not so bad and were cleaned up in just a few days, but then there was the big one.</p>
					<p>Returning home from a weekend trip I entered my apartment to an unusual smell. After unpacking I went into my kitchen to figure out what could be causing the smell. I tried turning on the light, but only heard a buzzing sound followed by a loud pop. Then I noticed a huge pool of water on my kitchen floor, and quickly called maintenance assuming no one was aware of the issue.</p>
					<p>Several rooms in my apartment were flooded and one of them was my home office which was worst case scenario for me. My home office contained lots of expensive electronics including my computer equipment which was also a source of income for me at the time.  It took two weeks for the apartment to be repaired to its pre-flooded state, and during that time, much of the apartment was torn apart with several industrial sized fans running 24/7.</p>
					<p>During the two weeks that my apartment was torn apart, I found myself having to be the one to coordinate the repair efforts and ensure that each of the contractors arrived when they were scheduled. I remained calm and cordial with everyone during the whole process. A couple of days after the flood I received a call from the property manager. She told me that there was a furnished guest apartment that I could use while my apartment was being worked on.  I thought that it was a great gesture until she noted that I would be charged for the use of this apartment, and that I should open a claim with my insurance provider to be reimbursed.  Deciding it shouldn’t be the responsibility of my insurance company to pay for the mistakes of others, I declined her offer and remained in my construction site with my fans through the entire ordeal.</p>
					<p>A month after the flood, there were still issues with my apartment, and I finally lost my temper.  Not once had anyone from Post Lindbergh, nor Post Properties offered so much as an apology for all the inconveniences this had caused me.  I proceeded to write a letter to David Stockert, CEO of Post Properties, which began a chain of emails in which Mr. Stockert never actually gave my letter the time of day. Each person responding to me simply used the leasing agreement as a means to alleviate Post Properties of any responsibilities beyond the repair of the apartment unit (timely or not). I was basically told that me being in this situation was my neighbor’s fault and that Post Properties did not owe me anything.  Guess that included the apology I never received.</p>
					<p>At this point I realized that the lack of customer service was a top down mentality for Post Properties, and I did my best to forgive Post Lindbergh realizing their lack of customer service stemmed from above.  Would it be too much to ask for a clean break when I decided to move out?  Guess so.</p>
					
					<h2>The Break-up:</h2>
					<p>I understand that break-ups are usually bad, but I never thought that included moving out of an apartment complex.  I knew to expect a low level of customer service based on my previous experiences with the leasing office, but I never expected them to purposely deceive me in order to gain a little less than $100.00.</p>
					<p>In October of 2012 I made the decision to become roommates with a friend of mine. I wanted to make sure that moving out of Post Lindbergh went smoothly, so I called up the leasing office and spoke with the property manager.  I knew I had to give a 60 day notice, so I called to ask about the process of doing so.  The property manager explained that I only needed to give a written statement to the leasing office announcing my move out date.  Later that week I also stopped by the leasing office to talk with the property manager in person.  The reason I wanted to talk with her specifically was because I would expect for her to be an expert on the policies governing Post Lindbergh, and I wanted to know of any “gotchas” when it comes to moving out.  I explained to her that I could make my move out date as early as the 20th of December because I would be out of town between Christmas and the New Year. I asked her one last question: Since my lease is up at the end of December, are there any issues with me making my move out date the 1st of January, or would an earlier date be better since I will be turning in my keys earlier than that anyhow?  She told me that the 1st was no problem at all, so I listed that date on my written notice and gave it to her.  I was told to expect a confirmation on the door within a few days.</p>
					<p>I received the confirmation letter a couple of days later, and it stated that I would owe $50.00 rent for the 1st of January.  I thought to myself: “Damn it!  Even after going through the trouble of taking off work, and sitting down with the property manager to be sure this wouldn’t happen, they still got me for $50.00.”  I reminded myself that I would soon be done with them and tried to brush it off.  However, when I received December’s bill I noticed that it was nearly $50.00 higher than usual.  I found that Post Lindbergh had also charged me for the 31st of December since my lease was up on the 30th. Assuming that this must have “slipped” the property manager’s mind during our previous discussion, I went the next day to speak with her about the extra charges.  I reminded her of our conversation a few weeks earlier, and asked her to change my move out date to the 30th to prevent the extra charges.  She responded by saying that she cannot remember every conversation she has ever had, and that I was simply being charged the prorated amount for the two days after my lease was up.  Even after I explained to her that the only reason I came to talk with her was to avoid this exact situation, she still refused to change my move out date explaining that it was not her job to educate me on the terms of the leasing agreement.  She went on to explain that she worked for a public company, and couldn’t make an exception for me that she wouldn’t make for one anyone else. (However, a friend of mine said that she was able to change her move out date with no problem. The only difference was that she was moving out of her current Post Lindbergh apartment into another unit.  There is no issue moving a person’s move out date when it is benefits Post Lindbergh).  It was then that I realized that I had been purposely deceived. There was nothing that could be done about it, and I could almost feel the property manager smiling on the inside as I left her office.  You live, and you learn right?</p>
					
					<h2>The End:</h2>
					<p>I would like to clarify that the intent of this message is not necessarily to persuade others not to lease an apartment from Post Lindbergh (though I would recommend exhausting all other possibilities), but more so this message is meant to be a warning for those who do choose to lease with Post Lindbergh.  You should be mindful when speaking with the leasing office, as they seem to only have their best interests in mind.  That said, be sure to fully understand EVERY line of your leasing agreement along with any other legal documents you sign (have an attorney look over them as well).</p>
					<p>I am mindful now of the mistakes that I made while living at Post Lindbergh, but I believe learning from mistakes is what helps us strengthen our minds. I hope those who read this message will have an opportunity to learn from my mistakes the way that I have.  Happy apartment hunting!</p>
